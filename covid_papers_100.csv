Real-World Experience with COVID-19  Including Direct COVID-19 Antigen Testing and Monoclonal-Antibody Bamlanivimab in a Rural Critical Access Hospital in South Dakota,This article summarizes the experiences of COVID-19 patients diagnosed and treated at Faulkton Area Medical Center  FAMC   a rural critical access facility in South Dakota  during three periods of COVID-19  Retrospective chart review was used to classify COVID-19 patients into three groups by time frame  1 Early March 2020  with the arrival of COVID-19 to South Dakota  until August 31  2020  2 September 1  2020  with the use of rapid result direct COVID-19 virus antigen testing  through November 24 2020  which took place during our COVID-19 surge   and 3 November 25  2020  the start of bamlanivimab infusions on high-risk patients with COVID-19  throughFebruary15  2021  the cutoff for this review  Faulk County had higher COVID-19 case rates and COVID-19 death rates than South Dakota in general  Final review of the data showed stable overall hospitalization rates at FAMC in each of these time periods  Data was broken down by age and not other demographics due to small patient population size and limited ability to blind data  Breakdown of the data showed the hospitalization rates in the 60-90  age groups did decrease from 33 3 percent to 22 2 percent  following bamlanivimab use  Absolute risk reduction 11 1 percent  Relative risk reduction of hospitalization from November 25  2020 through February 15  2021 compared to September 1  2020 through November 25  2020 was 0 33   odds ratio   0 57   CI  95 percent  0 21-1 58   This is not statistically significant  NNT 9  Data is limited by small overall numbers of patients and lack of data in Faulkton area residents who sought medical care outside the local facility,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35008137
Successful outcome of pre-engraftment COVID-19 in an HCT patient  impact of targeted therapies and cellular immunity,Coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19   caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  infection has emerged as a global pandemic that upended existing protocols and practices  including those for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation  HCT   Here we describe the successful clinical course and multiple key interventions administered to an acute lymphoblastic leukemia patient  who tested SARS-CoV-2 positive by RT-PCR on day -1 of matched unrelated donor  SARS-CoV-2 IgG negative  T-cell-replete HCT  This experience allowed for implementing a virologic and immunomonitoring panel to characterize the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the recipient s nascent humoral and cellular immune response  The finding of robust  functional  and persistent levels of SARS-CoV-2 specific T-cells  starting early after transplant was unexpected  and in combination with the clinical strategy may have contributed to the favorable outcome  Additionally  it is plausible that pre-existing cross-reactive endemic coronavirus immunity in the allogeneic graft reduced recipient susceptibility to COVID-19 disease  This case supports the critical role that T-cell responses may play in mitigating SARS-CoV-2 infection  even in the context of transplant immunosuppression  in which reconstitution of humoral response is commonly delayed  Interventional approaches to transfer SARS-CoV-2-specific cellular immunity such as HCT donor vaccination and adaptive cellular therapy could be of benefit,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35008104

Safer in care  A pandemic-tested model of integrated HIV OUD care,BACKGROUND  Rural  poor  persons with HIV  PWH  and substance use are among the most vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 and related health service disruptions  The objective of the study was to evaluate the health outcomes and utilization of PWH at an Outpatient-based Opioid Treatment  OBOT  Clinic  METHODS  We evaluated a clinic-based cohort at the University of Alabama at Birmingham HIV clinic from November 2018 to May 2021  We compared HIV outcomes of OBOT patients  who are highly vulnerable  to the overall clinic  We stratified OBOT patients according to comorbid stimulant use disorder and compared clinic utilization and viral load suppression in the 6 months before and after the safer at home mandate  May 2020  in Alabama  RESULTS  Of 3857 PWH  57 were referred to OBOT  48 attended  45 were initiated on buprenorphine  and 35 had a VL< 200 in the last 6 months  Relative to the overall HIV clinic  OBOT patients were significantly less likely to remain VL suppressed  90  vs 78   p   0 01   More patients were suppressed after OBOT linkage  81   than prior  73    For those referred before May 2020  there was no change in viral suppression before and after the safer at home order  75    Although new OBOT referrals did not increase during the pandemic  the number of visits attended per month did increase from a median of 3-4 per patient  CONCLUSIONS  Unlike many PWH who faced access barriers  PWH receiving care at OBOT did not fall out of care but increased healthcare utilization and maintained viral suppression despite the public health emergency,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35007957
The effect of Covid-19 in digital media use of Finnish physicians - Four wave longitudinal panel survey,BACKGROUND  Covid-19 pandemic has boosted digitalization in healthcare  as mobility restrictions and social distancing rules have made healthcare providers to adopt digital tools to replace or complement face-to-face interactions  PURPOSE  We discuss the effects of Covid-19 pandemic on physicians  use of digital media  We examine whether Covid-19 conditions have changed how physicians use internet resources for information search  how they engage in social media  and their attitude towards online events  BASIC PROCEDURES  The study was done as a longitudinal panel survey in four waves  The sample was a panel including active physicians in Finland  The panel was updated annually  Identical surveys were administered in 2018  2019  2020 and 2021  Spring 2020 was the time when Finland executed mobility restrictions and re-organization of healthcare because of pandemic  Comparing results of the survey before and after Covid-19 restrictions gives us a unique opportunity to do comparative analysis of Covid-19 effects  MAIN FINDINGS  Our results show that the use of digital media for information search stayed relatively stable without statistically significant change during the four-year period covered in the study  The use of social media rose steadily from 2018 to 2021 with no significant difference in the trend  However  there was a significant change in the attitude of Finnish physicians on online events  Year 2021  the attitude remained in this more positive level  PRINCIPAL CONCLUSIONS  As use of digital media including social media was already high prior Covid-19 in Finland  our results do not show significant change because of special circumstances introduced in 2020  However  our results show that the attitudes towards online events turned more positive during Covid-19 related restrictions  This could indicate that Covid-19 era has triggered a change that might continue also when pandemic related restrictions will be removed,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35007925
Scanning the RBD-ACE2 molecular interactions in Omicron variant,The emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants poses a threat to the human population where it is difficult to assess the severity of a particular variant of the virus  Spike protein and specifically its receptor binding domain  RBD  which makes direct interaction with the ACE2 receptor of the human has shown prominent amino acid substitutions in most of the Variants of Concern  Here  by using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations we compare the interaction of Wild-type RBD ACE2 receptor complex with that of the latest Omicron variant of the virus  We observed a very interesting diversification of the charge  dynamics and energetics of the protein complex formed upon mutations  These results would help us in understanding the molecular basis of binding of the Omicron variant with that of SARS-CoV-2 Wild-type,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35007846
Implications of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the clinical  hematological  and inflammatory parameters in COVID-19 patients  A retrospective cross-sectional study,BACKGROUND  The current coronavirus pandemic  COVID-19  was caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome virus 2  SARS-CoV-2   COVID-19 is characterized by atypical pneumonia  mild colds  and more severe illnesses  such as severe acute respiratory distress  thrombosis  organ failure  and various secondary bacterial and fungal infections  Notably  the severity of COVID-19 in different age groups is not well known  and the validity of clinical laboratory data remains unclear  METHODS  In this retrospective cross-sectional study  we examined differential regulation of clinical  hematologic  and inflammatory biomarkers in COVID-19 patients  We divided 104 COVID-19 patients into five different groups according to age  0-17  18-45  46-65  66-79  and >80 years   Baseline data  sex  comorbidities  intensive care admission  and medications   hematologic markers  liver  and renal function tests  coagulation  and inflammatory markers were examined in these groups  Receiver operator characteristic  ROC  analysis was used to determine the optimal threshold for predicting COVID-19 biological markers  RESULTS  We found that the highest percentage  45   of COVID-19 patients was in the age group of 46-65 years  The hematologic parameters  WBC  HB  and PLT  were normal between the patient groups  The area under the curve in ROC analysis showed significant differences in the levels of creatine  GGT  BUN  CRP  D-dimer  ferritin  AST  and procalcitonin between the patients of age groups 46-65 and 66-79 years  Renal biomarkers were significantly high in most patients  regardless of age  In contrast  the liver biomarkers  did not differ significantly between patient groups  CONCLUSION  The main finding of our study is that laboratory parameters such as GGT  creatinine  BUN  CRP  procalcitonin  ferritin and D-dimer were differentially regulated in COVID -19 patients of different age groups  Importantly  these laboratory parameters may help as clinical predictors to assess the severity of the disease in the population  We conclude here that age is an important factor influencing COVID-19 severity,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35007842
Merbromin is a mixed-type inhibitor of 3-chyomotrypsin like protease of SARS-CoV-2,3-chyomotrypsin like protease  3CLpro  has been considered as a promising target for developing anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs  Herein  about 6000 compounds were analyzed by high-throughput screening using enzyme activity model  and Merbromin  an antibacterial agent  was identified as a potent inhibitor of 3CLpro  Merbromin strongly inhibited the proteolytic activity of 3CLpro but not the other three proteases Proteinase K  Trypsin and Papain  Michaelis-Menten kinetic analysis showed that Merbromin was a mixed-type inhibitor of 3CLpro  due to its ability of increasing the KM and decreasing the Kcat of 3CLpro  The binding assays and molecular docking suggested that 3CLpro possessed two binding sites for Merbromin  Consistently  Merbromin showed a weak binding to the other three proteases  Together  these findings demonstrated that Merbromin is a selective inhibitor of 3CLpro and provided a scaffold to design effective inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35007835
Implementation of large-scale laboratory-based detection of COVID-19 in the Veterans Health Administration  March 2020 - February 2021,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  presented numerous operational challenges to healthcare delivery networks responsible for implementing large scale detection of Coronavirus Disease 2019  COVID-19   the infection caused by SARS-CoV-2  We describe testing performance  review data quality metrics  and summarize experiences during the scale up of laboratory-based detection of COVID-19 in the Veterans Health Administration  the largest healthcare system in the United States  During March 2020 to February 2021  we observed rapid increase in testing volume  decreases in test turnaround time  improvements in testing of hospitalized persons  changes in test positivity  and varying utilization of different tests  Though performance metrics improved over time  surges challenged testing capacity and data quality remained suboptimal  Future planning efforts should focus on fortifying supply chains for consumables and equipment repair  optimizing distribution of testing workload across laboratories  and improving informatics to accurately monitor operations and intent for testing during a public health emergency,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35007825
The psychological impact of therapeutic changes during the COVID-19-lockdown for gynaecological and breast cancer patients,OBJECTIVE  The exceptional health situation related to the Coronavirus 2019  COVID-19  pandemic has required an in-depth and immediate reorganisation of gynaecological cancer care  The main objective was to assess the psychological impact of such treatment modifications during the lockdown period for gynaecological and breast cancer patients  PATIENTS AND METHODS  A multicentre prospective study was conducted in three university gynaecological cancer wards  Hospices Civils de Lyon  France  during the French first lockdown  16 th  March to 11 th  May 2020   All patients with non-metastatic breast cancer or gynaecological cancer were included  Data was collected regarding treatment modifications  delay  cancellation  change of therapeutic plan   The psychological impact of treatment modifications during and after the lockdown was assessed by validated questionnaires  SF-12  EORTC-QLQ-C30  HADS   RESULTS  A total of 205 consecutive patients were included  aged 60 5   -1 0 years  Seven patients  3 4   presented a SARS-CoV-2 infection  and two patients died  Treatment was maintained for 122  59 5   patients  postponed for 72  35 1   and cancelled for 11  5 4    During the lockdown  35 118  29 7   patients suffered from confirmed anxiety and the mean fatigue-EORTC score was 48 00   -2 51  it was 38 64   -2 33  p 0 02  after the lockdown  After the lockdown and compared to the lockdown period  the mental SF-12 score and overall health status EORTC score were significantly higher  45 03   -1 06 vs 41 71   -1 15  p 0 02 and 64 58   -1 66 vs 57 44   -2 02  p 0 0007  respectively   The number of confirmed-anxiety cases was significantly higher among patients for whom treatment was delayed or cancelled  40 5  vs 23 7   p 0 04   CONCLUSION  This study quantified the treatment modifications of gynaecological cancer patients during the COVID-19 lockdown and revealed a poorer psychological state and quality of life during this period  even for patients whose treatment plan was not actually modified  Anxiety was more significant in patients with a delayed or cancelled treatment,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35007776
Non-invasive administration of AAV to target lung parenchymal cells and develop SARS-CoV-2-susceptible mice,Adeno-associated virus  AAV -mediated gene delivery holds great promise for gene therapy  However  the non-invasive delivery of AAV for lung tissues has not been adequately established  Here  we revealed that the intratracheal administration of an appropriate amount of AAV2 8 predominantly targets lung tissue  AAV-mediated gene delivery that we used in this study induced the expression of the desired protein in lung parenchymal cells  including alveolar type II cells  We harnessed the technique to develop severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2 -susceptible mice  Three kinds of immune function-relevant gene knockout  KO  mice were transduced with AAV encoding human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2  hACE2  and then injected with SARS-CoV-2  Among these mice  type I interferon receptor  IFNAR  KO mice showed increased viral titer in the lungs compared to that in the other KO mice  Moreover  nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 and multiple lesions in the trachea and lung were observed in AAV-hACE2-transduced  SARS-CoV-2-infected IFNAR KO mice  indicating the involvement of type I interferon signaling in the protection of SARS-CoV-2  In this study  we demonstrate the ease and rapidness of the intratracheal administration of AAV for targeting lung tissue in mice and this can be potentially used to study diverse pulmonary diseases,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35007757
A novel antibody against the furin cleavage site of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein  effects on proteolytic cleavage and ACE2 binding,SARS-CoV-2 harbors a unique S1 S2 furin cleavage site within its spike protein  which can be cleaved by furin and other proprotein convertases  Proteolytic activation of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein at the S1 S2 boundary facilitates interaction with host ACE2 receptor for cell entry  To address this  high titer antibody was generated against the SARS-CoV-2-specific furin motif  Using a series of innovative ELISA-based assays  this furin site blocking antibody displayed high sensitivity and specificity for the S1 S2 furin cleavage site  including with a P681R mutation  and demonstrated effective blockage of both enzyme-mediated cleavage and spike-ACE2 interaction  The results suggest that immunological blocking of the furin cleavage site may afford a suitable approach to stem proteolytic activation of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and curtail viral infectivity,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35007661
Impact of COVID-19 on male fertility,COVID-19  the clinical condition caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus  has been associated with massive cytokine storm and damage to multiple organ systems  Although evidence for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus in the testis remains scarce  testicular damage and dysregulation of gonadotropins associated with inflammation has been reported  Additionally  as a result of the rapidly evolving pandemic  frequently updated medical interventions and public policies leading to delays of care can play a role in fertility  This narrative review aims to summarize the current literature on how COVID-19 may influence male fertility,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35007621
Environmental risks of polymer materials from disposable face masks linked to the COVID-19 pandemic,The indispensable role of plastic products in our daily life is highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic again  Disposable face masks  made of polymer materials  as effective and cheap personal protective equipment  PPE   have been extensively used by the public to slow down the viral transmission  The repercussions of this have generated million tons of plastic waste being littered into the environment because of the improper disposal and mismanagement amid  And plastic waste can release microplastics  MPs  with the help of physical  chemical and biological processes  which is placing a huge MPs contamination burden on the ecosystem  In this work  the knowledge regarding to the combined effects of MPs and pollutants from the release of face masks and the impacts of wasted face masks and MPs on the environment  terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem  was systematically discussed  In view of these  some green technologies were put forward to reduce the amounts of discarded face masks in the environment  therefore minimizing MPs pollution at its source  Moreover  some recommendations for future research directions were proposed based on the remaining knowledge gaps  In a word  MPs pollution linked to face masks should be a focus worldwide,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35007580
Passively sensing SARS-CoV-2 RNA in public transit buses,Affordably tracking the transmission of respiratory infectious diseases in urban transport infrastructures can inform individuals about potential exposure to diseases and guide public policymakers to prepare timely responses based on geographical transmission in different areas in the city  Towards that end  we designed and tested a method to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the air filters of public buses  revealing that air filters could be used as passive fabric sensors for the detection of viral presence  We placed and retrieved filters in the existing HVAC systems of public buses to test for the presence of trapped SARS-CoV-2 RNA using phenol-chloroform extraction and RT-qPCR  SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 14   5 37  of public bus filters tested in Seattle  Washington  from August 2020 to March 2021  These results indicate that this sensing system is feasible and that  if scaled  this method could provide a unique lens into the geographically relevant transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through public transit rider vectors  pooling samples of riders over time in a passive manner without installing any additional systems on transit vehicles,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35007574
A vaccine built from potential immunogenic pieces derived from the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein  A computational approximation,Coronavirus Disease 2019  COVID-19  represents a new global threat demanding a multidisciplinary effort to fight its etiological agent-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2   In this regard  immunoinformatics may aid to predict prominent immunogenic regions from critical SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins  such as the spike  S  glycoprotein  for their use in prophylactic or therapeutic interventions against this highly pathogenic betacoronavirus  Accordingly  in this study  an integrated immunoinformatics approach was applied to identify cytotoxic T cell  CTC   T helper cell  THC   and Linear B cell  BC  epitopes from the S glycoprotein in an attempt to design a high-quality multi-epitope vaccine  The best CTC  THC  and BC epitopes showed high viral antigenicity and lack of allergenic or toxic residues  as well as CTC and THC epitopes showed suitable interactions with HLA class I  HLA-I  and HLA class II  HLA-II  molecules  respectively  Remarkably  SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain  RBD  and its receptor-binding motif  RBM  harbour several potential epitopes  The structure prediction  refinement  and validation data indicate that the multi-epitope vaccine has an appropriate conformation and stability  Three conformational epitopes and an efficient binding between Toll-like receptor 4  TLR4  and the vaccine model were observed  Importantly  the population coverage analysis showed that the multi-epitope vaccine could be used globally  Notably  computer-based simulations suggest that the vaccine model has a robust potential to evoke and maximize both immune effector responses and immunological memory to SARS-CoV-2  Further research is needed to accomplish with the mandatory international guidelines for human vaccine formulations,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35007561
PICU in the MICU  how adult intensive care units can support pediatric care in public health emergencies,Initial waves of the 2019 coronavirus disease  COVID-19  pandemic have largely spared children  With the advent of vaccination in many older age groups and the spread of the highly-contagious Delta variant  however  children now represent a growing percentage of COVID-19 cases  Pediatric intensive care unit  PICU  capacity is far less than that of adult ICUs  Adult ICUs may need to support pediatric care  much as PICUs provided adult care earlier in the pandemic  Critically-ill children selected for care in adult settings should be at least 12 years of age and ideally have conditions common in children and adults alike  such as community-acquired sepsis or trauma  Children with complex  pediatric-specific disorders are best served in PICUs and are not recommended for transfer  The goal of such transfers is to maintain critical capacity for those children in greatest need of the PICU s unique abilities  thus preserving systems of care for all children,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35007553
Addressing the Shadow Pandemic  COVID-19 Related Impacts  Barriers  Needs  and Priorities to Healthcare and Support for Women Survivors of Intimate Partner Violence and Brain Injury,BACKGROUND  Intimate partner violence  IPV  affects one in three women and has intensified during the COVID-19 pandemic  Although most injuries are to the head  face  and neck  the intersection of IPV and traumatic brain injury  TBI  remains largely unrecognized  This paper reports on COVID-19-related impacts  barriers  needs  and priorities to healthcare and support services for women survivors of IPV-TBI  METHODS  Using a participatory research model  we engaged 30 stakeholders in virtual meetings drawn from an IPV-TBI Knowledge to Practice  K2P  Network including women survivors  service providers  researchers  and decision makers  Data was gathered through small group breakout sessions facilitated by the research team using semi-structured discussion guides  Sessions were recorded  transcribed verbatim transcripts  and analysed using thematic analysis techniques  Stakeholders were given the opportunity to contribute to the analysis and knowledge transfer through member checking activities  Ethics approval was obtained through the University of Toronto  RESULTS  COVID-19 has increased rates and severity of IPV and barriers to services and help-seeking  These effects are exacerbated by infrastructure difficulties in rural and remote areas  including limited access to services  Implications of virtual care such as safety  privacy  and usability require careful consideration  Requests from survivors for peer support have increased significantly  indicating more formalized and better-supported peer roles are needed  An overwhelming lack of awareness of the intersection of IPV-TBI continues  Increasing education and awareness among healthcare and IPV service providers  survivors  and the public remains a priority  CONCLUSIONS  The COVID-19 pandemic has intensified IPV-TBI  increased challenges for women survivors  and accentuated the continued lack of IPV-TBI awareness  Key recommendations for healthcare and rehabilitation to address this priority are discussed,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35007550

Divergent changes  abstinence and higher-frequency substance use increase among racial ethnic minority young adults during the COVID-19 global pandemic,BACKGROUND  Identifying factors influencing substance use among racial ethnic minorities  REM  is important given the disproportionate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on this population  OBJECTIVES  We examined factors in four domains and hypothesized that poor mental health  negative coping behaviors  negative environmental aspects  and belonging to more vulnerable social groups would be associated with increased substance use during the pandemic  METHODS  Multiple regression was applied to longitudinal data from a college sample assessed prior  fall 2017 to spring 2019  and during  spring 2020  the pandemic  n  323  81 5  cisgender women  34 5  African-American  36 1  Asian-American  15 5  Hispanic Latinx  11 8  multi-racial  to identify factors predicting current alcohol  cannabis  and nicotine use frequency  spring 2020  and change in frequency of use between springs 2019 and 2020  RESULTS  While infrequent substance use  monthly or less  decreased during the pandemic  abstinence rates increased  alcohol 39   cannabis 18   nicotine 18   and higher-frequency alcohol use increased  207 -1600  2-3 times  week  compared to spring 2019  The strongest protective factor was change in living situation during the pandemic  associated with lower current alcohol and cannabis use  Risk factors included a history of trouble with police and impulsivity since the pandemic  both associated with higher current and increased alcohol and cannabis use  REM did not differ on most factors and the outcomes  However  a higher percentage of Asian-Americans than other REM reported living situation changes  CONCLUSION  Substance use rates diverged during the pandemic  with both increased abstinence and higher-frequency use  attributed mostly to mental health and environmental domain factors with few REM differences,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35007453
Adolescent Psychosocial Adjustment during COVID-19  An Intensive Longitudinal Study,OBJECTIVE  COVID-19 has presented threats to adolescents  psychosocial well-being  especially for those from economically disadvantaged backgrounds  This longitudinal study aimed to identify which social  i e   family conflict  parental social support  peer social support   emotional  i e   COVID-19 health-related stress   and physical  i e   sleep quality  food security  factors influence adolescents  same- and next-day affect and misconduct and whether these factors functioned differently by adolescents  economic status  METHOD  Daily-diary approaches were used to collect 12 033 assessments over 29 days from a nationwide sample of American adolescents  n  546  Mage   15 0  40  male  43  Black  37  White  10  Latinx  8  Asian American  and 3  Native American  61  low-income  at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic  RESULTS  Peer support  parent support  and sleep quality operated as promotive factors  whereas parent-child conflict and COVID-19 health-related stress operated as risk factors  Although these links were consistent for adolescents irrespective of economic status  low-income adolescents experienced more conflict with parents  more COVID-19 health-related stress  less peer support  and lower sleep quality than higher-income adolescents  Food insecurity was connected to decreased same- and next-day negative affect for low-income adolescents only  Low-income adolescents also displayed greater negative affect in response to increased daily health-related stress relative to higher-income adolescents  CONCLUSION  These results highlight the role of proximal processes in shaping adolescent adjustment and delineate key factors influencing youth psychosocial well-being in the context of COVID-19  By understanding adolescents  responses to stressors at the onset of the pandemic  practitioners and healthcare providers can make evidence-based decisions regarding clinical treatment and intervention planning for youth most at risk for developmental maladjustment,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35007446
Clinician Preferences for Current and Planned Future Use of Telemedicine,Introduction  Many clinicians and patients tried telemedicine for the first time during the COVID-19 pandemic  In a prior survey  we found that clinicians who were adaptable and willing to incorporate technology into their clinical practice are more likely to utilize telemedicine  Seeking factors associated with current and future use of telemedicine  and identifying its relative advantages and drawbacks  may help determine the role of telemedicine after the pandemic  Questions Purposes  We asked  1  which demographic factors and personal preferences are associated with current and planned future use of telemedicine   2  what factors are associated with telemedicine utilization  and  3  what are clinician-reported advantages and disadvantages of telemedicine  Materials and Methods  Approximately 750 clinicians within a national multispecialty hospital group were invited to complete an online survey assessing telemedicine use and preferences  self-reported technology proficiency  and personal characteristics  A total of 284 clinicians started the survey  and 259 complete responses were analyzed using bivariate analysis and multivariable regression  Results  More frequent current telemedicine use was associated with being a nonsurgeon clinician  not primarily practicing in an inpatient setting  preferring either telemedicine or having no preference for discussing sensitive topics  and greater self-reported technological proficiency  Planned future telemedicine use was associated with greater self-reported troubleshoot ability and less desire for a hands-on physical examination  Clinicians reported that the top benefits of telemedicine are decreased barriers for patients and convenience for clinicians  and disadvantages are technical difficulties for both patients and clinicians  Conclusions  Telemedicine continues to be widely utilized by clinicians  particularly those who are confident in their ability to examine patients over video  and who can troubleshoot issues that arise on the platform  With continued reimbursement  telemedicine is likely to remain a convenient and effective method of caring for patients,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35007442
Providers at a Midwestern Academic System Report a Positive Experience with Telehealth During the COVID-19 Pandemic,Introduction  Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic  there has been rapid expansion in the use of telehealth  As a result  many providers who had no prior experience using telehealth are now using it to provide patient care  The goal of this study was to survey health care providers on a wide range of telehealth topics including their experiences examining and connecting with patients digitally  identifying which types of patients may be best suited to telehealth  and identifying technical and logistical areas for improvement when using telehealth  Methods  Physicians and advanced practice providers  n   944  at a large midwestern academic system were invited to complete an anonymous online survey during a 2-week period in October 2020  Results  Surveys  completed and analyzed  n   178   indicated 86 6  of respondents felt confident in their clinical assessment  and 86 1  felt they formed an adequate personal connection with the patient in the majority of telehealth visits  A majority  58 5   of providers felt telehealth was not effective for new patients  but 83  of providers felt it was effective for providing care to established patients  Respondents identified several areas for technological improvement including issues with video  27 5   and audio  16 8   quality  In 24 4  of visits  these technology issues were severe enough providers needed to convert an audiovisual appointment to telephone  Conclusions  Provider experience with telehealth has largely been positive at our institution  Although telehealth may not be appropriate for new patients  providers did feel it was an effective means of providing care for established patients  To continue improving the quality of telehealth  a multiteam approach should be considered  including members of technology and clinical operations teams working closely with those providers experienced in telehealth,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35007435
Review of Clinical Performance of Serology Based Commercial Diagnostic Assays for Detection of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Antibodies,The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  virus  which caused the coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  pandemic as declared by the World Health Organization  has created havoc worldwide  The highly transmissible infection can be contained only by accurate diagnosis  quarantining  and exercising social distancing  Therefore  quick and massive deployment of SARS-CoV-2 testing plays a crucial role in the identification and isolation of infected patients  Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction is the gold standard for COVID-19 detection  however  it needs expertise  facilities  and time  Hence  for the ease of population-wide screening  serology-based diagnostic assays were introduced  These can help determine the prevalence of infection  understand the epidemiology of the disease  and assist in suitable public health interventions while being user-friendly and less time consuming  Although serological testing kits in markets soared  their sensitivity and specificity were questioned in reports from different parts of the world  In this article  we have reviewed 40 Food and Drug Administration  FDA  and CE-approved clinically evaluated serological kits  8 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay  ELISA  kits  10 chemiluminescent immunoassay  CLIA  kits  and 22 lateral flow immunoassay  LFIA  kits  for their sensitivity and specificity and discussed the apparent reasons behind their performance  We observed appreciable sensitivity in the kits detecting total antibodies compared to the kits targeting single isotype antibodies  Tests that determined antibodies against nucleocapsid protein were found to be more sensitive and those detecting antibodies against spike protein were found to have greater specificity  This study was conducted to help the decision-making while acquiring antibody kits and concurrently to be mindful of their shortcomings,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35007431
The respond to the COVID-19 pandemic of dental hygienist in South Korea Part   Infection control knowledge and practice,OBJECTIVES  To evaluate infection control knowledge and its practice of clinical dental hygienists in response to Coronavirus Disease 2019  COVID-19  in South Korea  METHODS  9 questions  Q9-K  on the degree of knowledge acquisition of dental hygienists in response to COVID-19  and another 9 questions  Q9-P  on the practices for COVID-19 infection and spread prevention were prepared  From 500 clinical dental hygienists in South Korea  answers about their general characteristics  Q9-K  and Q9-P were collected  1 point was given to each question based on the  yes  answers from Q9-K and Q9-P  and Score-K and Score-P were calculated  respectively  To identify factors affecting Score-P  multiple linear regression analysis was performed  In all analyses  p-values lower than 0 05 were considered statistically significant  RESULTS  Average scores of Score-K and Score-P were 7 36  -1 35 and 6 26  -2 07  respectively  The regression model of Score-P was significant  F 20 788  p<0 001   With respect to Score-P  Score-K  beta 0 385   age  beta 0 275   dental hospital  beta 0 158   monthly income of  2 360 approximately  2 730  beta 0 104  had a significantly positive correlation  and the total years of career  beta -0 293  are found to have a significantly negative correlation  CONCLUSIONS  Infection control knowledge and practice of clinical dental hygienists in South Korea was found to be vulnerable in the group of hygienists who are younger than 27 years old  working in dental clinics  and whose monthly income is less than under  2000  Also  the factor that influences infection control practice the most was the degree of knowledge  Therefore  continuous infection control education and supplement targeting these vulnerable groups are necessary,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35007394

Prevention adopted by healthcare workers within their families in the Covid-19 pandemic,OBJECTIVE  To identify factors associated with the adoption of non-pharmacological preventive measures against covid-19 by healthcare workers within their families  METHOD  This is an analytical cross-sectional study carried out from October 1st to December 31st  2020  with 11 513 healthcare workers in Brazil  Data collection through a virtual questionnaire on the platform Survey Monkey  To characterize the participants  descriptive statistical analysis was used with measures of absolute and relative frequency  Using inferential statistics  independent variables and outcome were compared  with hypothesis tests for association  chi-square  Fisher s exact test   logistic regression  and Woe analysis  A significance level of 95  was used  RESULTS  Most workers used measures such as hand hygiene  environmental sanitation  food hygiene  use of fabric masks  and physical distancing from family members  The association among variables was significant for the region  especially the South region  female sex  and nursing professionals  CONCLUSION  Healthcare workers adopt preventive measures against covid-19 within family life  especially the women and nursing professionals  with family isolation being the measure of greatest adherence,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35007318
Coping moderates the relationship between intolerance of uncertainty and stress in men during the Covid-19 pandemic,OBJECTIVE  To test the explanatory power of coping strategies and intolerance of uncertainty on men s perceived stress levels and test the moderating role of coping strategies in the relationship between intolerance of uncertainty and perceived stress during the Covid-19 pandemic  METHOD  This was an online cross-sectional study in which 1 006 men living in Brazil during the Covid-19 pandemic participated  Participants were recruited using a snowball sampling technique and completed a questionnaire containing measures of all study variables  Data were examined using a correlation and a regression analysis  RESULTS  Intolerance of uncertainty  beta    51  and refusal  beta    15  positively predicted perceived stress  whereas control  beta   - 31  and isolation  beta   - 06  negatively predicted it  Together  these variables explained 52  of men s perceived stress  p <  001   Isolation and social support lessened the relationship between intolerance of uncertainty and stress  p <  001   CONCLUSION  Men high in intolerance of uncertainty and refusal were more vulnerable to stress during the pandemic  However  coping helped mitigate the relationship between intolerance of uncertainty and perceived stress  thus being a promising psychosocial intervention in this context,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35007317
Long non-coding RNAs  lncRNAs  NEAT1 and MALAT1 are differentially expressed in severe COVID-19 patients  An integrated single-cell analysis,Hyperactive and damaging inflammation is a hallmark of severe rather than mild Coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19   To uncover key inflammatory differentiators between severe and mild COVID-19  we applied an unbiased single-cell transcriptomic analysis  We integrated two single-cell RNA-seq datasets with COVID-19 patient samples  one that sequenced bronchoalveolar lavage  BAL  cells and one that sequenced peripheral blood mononuclear cells  PBMCs   The combined cell population was then analyzed with a focus on genes associated with disease severity  The immunomodulatory long non-coding RNAs  lncRNAs  NEAT1 and MALAT1 were highly differentially expressed between mild and severe patients in multiple cell types  Within those same cell types  the concurrent detection of other severity-associated genes involved in cellular stress response and apoptosis regulation suggests that the pro-inflammatory functions of these lncRNAs may foster cell stress and damage  Thus  NEAT1 and MALAT1 are potential components of immune dysregulation in COVID-19 that may provide targets for severity related diagnostic measures or therapy,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35007307
Hyperinflammatory environment drives dysfunctional myeloid cell effector response to bacterial challenge in COVID-19,COVID-19 displays diverse disease severities and symptoms including acute systemic inflammation and hypercytokinemia  with subsequent dysregulation of immune cells  Bacterial superinfections in COVID-19 can further complicate the disease course and are associated with increased mortality  However  there is limited understanding of how SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and hypercytokinemia impede the innate immune function against bacterial superinfections  We assessed the influence of COVID-19 plasma hypercytokinemia on the functional responses of myeloid immune cells upon bacterial challenges from acute-phase COVID-19 patients and their corresponding recovery  rec -phase  We show that a severe hypercytokinemia status in COVID-19 patients correlates with the development of bacterial superinfections  Neutrophils and monocytes derived from COVID-19 patients in their acute-phase showed an impaired intracellular microbicidal capacity upon bacterial challenges  The impaired microbicidal capacity was reflected by abrogated MPO and reduced NETs production in neutrophils along with reduced ROS production in both neutrophils and monocytes  Moreover  we observed a distinct pattern of cell surface receptor expression on both neutrophils and monocytes  in line with suppressed autocrine and paracrine cytokine signaling  This phenotype was characterized by a high expression of CD66b  CXCR4 and low expression of CXCR1  CXCR2 and CD15 in neutrophils and low expression of HLA-DR  CD86 and high expression of CD163 and CD11b in monocytes  Furthermore  the impaired antibacterial effector function was mediated by synergistic effect of the cytokines TNF-alpha  IFN-gamma and IL-4  COVID-19 patients receiving dexamethasone showed a significant reduction of overall inflammatory markers in the plasma as well as exhibited an enhanced immune response towards bacterial challenge ex vivo  Finally  broad anti-inflammatory treatment was associated with a reduction in CRP  IL-6 levels as well as length of ICU and hospital stay in critically ill COVID-19 patients  Our data provides insights into the transient functional dysregulation of myeloid immune cells against subsequent bacterial infections in COVID-19 patients and describe a beneficial role for the use of dexamethasone in these patients,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35007290
Obstetric interventions and pregnancy outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic in England  A nationwide cohort study,BACKGROUND  The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted maternity services worldwide and imposed restrictions on societal behaviours  This national study aimed to compare obstetric intervention and pregnancy outcome rates in England during the pandemic and corresponding pre-pandemic calendar periods  and to assess whether differences in these rates varied according to ethnic and socioeconomic background  METHODS AND FINDINGS  We conducted a national study of singleton births in English National Health Service hospitals  We compared births during the COVID-19 pandemic period  23 March 2020 to 22 February 2021  with births during the corresponding calendar period 1 year earlier  The Hospital Episode Statistics database provided administrative hospital data about maternal characteristics  obstetric inventions  induction of labour  elective or emergency cesarean section  and instrumental birth   and outcomes  stillbirth  preterm birth  small for gestational age  SGA  birthweight < 10th centile   prolonged maternal length of stay  >  3 days   and maternal 42-day readmission   Multi-level logistic regression models were used to compare intervention and outcome rates between the corresponding pre-pandemic and pandemic calendar periods and to test for interactions between pandemic period and ethnic and socioeconomic background  All models were adjusted for maternal characteristics including age  obstetric history  comorbidities  and COVID-19 status at birth  The study included 948 020 singleton births  maternal characteristics  median age 30 years  41 6  primiparous  8 3  with gestational diabetes  2 4  with preeclampsia  and 1 6  with pre-existing diabetes or hypertension   451 727 births occurred during the defined pandemic period  Maternal characteristics were similar in the pre-pandemic and pandemic periods  Compared to the pre-pandemic period  stillbirth rates remained similar  0 36  pandemic versus 0 37  pre-pandemic  p   0 16   Preterm birth and SGA birth rates were slightly lower during the pandemic  6 0  versus 6 1  for preterm births  adjusted odds ratio  aOR  0 96  95  CI 0 94-0 97  5 6  versus 5 8  for SGA births  aOR 0 95  95  CI 0 93-0 96  both p < 0 001   Slightly higher rates of obstetric intervention were observed during the pandemic  40 4  versus 39 1  for induction of labour  aOR 1 04  95  CI 1 03-1 05  13 9  versus 12 9  for elective cesarean section  aOR 1 13  95  CI 1 11-1 14  18 4  versus 17 0  for emergency cesarean section  aOR 1 07  95  CI 1 06-1 08  all p < 0 001   Lower rates of prolonged maternal length of stay  16 7  versus 20 2   aOR 0 77  95  CI 0 76-0 78  p < 0 001  and maternal readmission  3 0  versus 3 3   aOR 0 88  95  CI 0 86-0 90  p < 0 001  were observed during the pandemic period  There was some evidence that differences in the rates of preterm birth  emergency cesarean section  and unassisted vaginal birth varied according to the mother s ethnic background but not according to her socioeconomic background  A key limitation is that multiple comparisons were made  increasing the chance of false-positive results  CONCLUSIONS  In this study  we found very small decreases in preterm birth and SGA birth rates and very small increases in induction of labour and elective and emergency cesarean section during the COVID-19 pandemic  with some evidence of a slightly different pattern of results in women from ethnic minority backgrounds  These changes in obstetric intervention rates and pregnancy outcomes may be linked to women s behaviour  environmental exposure  changes in maternity practice  or reduced staffing levels,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35007282
A Report on the First 7 Sequential Patients Treated Within the C-Reactive Protein Apheresis in COVID  CACOV  Registry,BACKGROUND Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2 -induced pneumonia is a disease with high mortality and  still  no effective treatment  Excessively elevated C-reactive protein  CRP  plasma levels inversely correlate with prognosis  As CRP  via complement and macrophage activation  can cause organ damage in COVID-19  we have recently introduced selective CRP apheresis as a potentially effective treatment  Now  we report on the first patients with severe SARS-CoV-2-induced pneumonia treated within the  C-reactive protein Apheresis in COVID   CACOV  registry  CASE REPORT Seven sequential hospitalized patients with documented COVID-19  strongly elevated CRP plasma levels  and respiratory failure were treated by selective CRP apheresis in addition to standard therapy after having given their informed consent for inclusion in the CACOV registry  We performed 2-8 CRP apheresis sessions via either peripheral or central venous access depending on clinical course and CRP plasma levels  CRP apheresis  in COVID-19  reduced CRP plasma levels by approximately 50-90   and it was thus highly effective  feasible  and safe  Despite severe radiological lung involvement in all our patients  only 2 patients finally required intubation  and none required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation  ECMO   All 7 patients were discharged from our 2 hospitals in good clinical condition  CONCLUSIONS Selective CRP apheresis  starting early after patient admission  may be an effective treatment of SARS-CoV-2-induced pneumonia  SARS-COV-2 can cause organ damage and multiple organ failure predominantly by an excessive CRP-mediated autoimmune response of the ancient innate immune system  Further registry data and randomized trials are needed,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35007274
The Detrimental Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Major Trauma Outcomes in the Netherlands  A Comprehensive Nationwide Study,OBJECTIVE  To evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the outcome of major trauma patients in the Netherlands  SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA  Major trauma patients highly rely on immediate access to specialized services  including ICUs  shortages caused by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may influence their outcome  METHODS  A multi-center observational cohort study  based on the Dutch National Trauma Registry was performed  Characteristics  resource usage  and outcome of major trauma patients  injury severity score >  16  treated at all trauma-receiving hospitals during the first COVID-19 peak  March 23 through May 10  were compared with those treated from the same period in 2018 and 2019  reference period   RESULTS  During the peak period  520 major trauma patients were admitted  versus 570 on average in the pre-COVID-19 years  Significantly fewer patients were admitted to ICU facilities during the peak than during the reference period  49 6  vs 55 8   P 0 016   Patients with less severe traumatic brain injuries in particular were less often admitted to the ICU during the peak  40 5  vs 52 5   P 0 005   Moreover  this subgroup showed an increased mortality compared to the reference period  13 5  vs 7 7   P 0 044   These results were confirmed using multivariable logistic regression analyses  In addition  a significant increase in observed versus predicted mortality was recorded for patients who had a priori predicted mortality of 50  to 75   P 0 012   CONCLUSIONS  The COVID-19 peak had an adverse effect on trauma care as major trauma patients were less often admitted to ICU and specifically those with minor through moderate brain injury had higher mortality rates,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35007227

Cannabinoids Block Cellular Entry of SARS-CoV-2 and the Emerging Variants,As a complement to vaccines  small-molecule therapeutic agents are needed to treat or prevent infections by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2  SARS-CoV-2  and its variants  which cause COVID-19  Affinity selection-mass spectrometry was used for the discovery of botanical ligands to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein  Cannabinoid acids from hemp  Cannabis sativa  were found to be allosteric as well as orthosteric ligands with micromolar affinity for the spike protein  In follow-up virus neutralization assays  cannabigerolic acid and cannabidiolic acid prevented infection of human epithelial cells by a pseudovirus expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and prevented entry of live SARS-CoV-2 into cells  Importantly  cannabigerolic acid and cannabidiolic acid were equally effective against the SARS-CoV-2 alpha variant B 1 1 7 and the beta variant B 1 351  Orally bioavailable and with a long history of safe human use  these cannabinoids  isolated or in hemp extracts  have the potential to prevent as well as treat infection by SARS-CoV-2,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35007072
Magnetic Nanoparticles for Biomedical Applications  From the Soul of the Earth to the Deep History of Ourselves,Precisely engineered magnetic nanoparticles  MNPs  have been widely explored for applications including theragnostic platforms  drug delivery systems  biomaterial device coatings  tissue engineering scaffolds  performance-enhanced therapeutic alternatives  and even in SARS-CoV-2 detection strips  Such popularity is due to their unique  challenging  and tailorable physicochemical magnetic properties  Given the wide biomedical-related potential applications of MNPs  significant achievements have been reached and published  exponentially  in the last five years  both in synthesis and application tailoring  Within this review  and in addition to essential works in this field  we have focused on the latest representative reports regarding the biomedical use of MNPs including characteristics related to their oriented synthesis  tailored geometry  and designed multibiofunctionality  Further  actual trends  needs  and limitations of magnetic-based nanostructures for biomedical applications will also be discussed,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35006927
Antiviral Properties of Alginate-Based Biomaterials  Promising Antiviral Agents against SARS-CoV-2,The COVID-19 pandemic has made it essential to explore alternative antiviral materials  Alginate is a biodegradable  renewable  biocompatible  water-soluble and antiviral biopolymer with many potential biomedical applications  In this regard  this review shows 17 types of viruses that have been tested in contact with alginate and its related biomaterials  Most of these studies show that alginate-based materials possess little or no toxicity and are able to inhibit a wide variety of viruses affecting different organisms  in humans by the human immunodeficiency virus type 1  the hepatitis A  B  and C viruses  Sindbis virus  herpes simplex virus type 1 and 2  poliovirus type 1  rabies virus  rubella virus  and the influenza virus  in mice by the murine norovirus  in bacteria by the T4 coliphage  and in plants by the tobacco mosaic virus and the potato virus X  Many of these are enveloped positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses  like SARS-CoV-2  which render alginate-based materials highly promising in the COVID-19 pandemic,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35006918
Near-Infrared Light Brightens Bacterial Disinfection  Recent Progress and Perspectives,Bacterial infection is a universal threat to public health  which not only causes many serious diseases but also exacerbates the condition of the patients of cancer  pandemic diseases  e g   COVID-19  and so on  Antibiotic therapy has been used to be an effective way for common bacterial disinfection  However  due to the misuse and abuse of antibiotics  more and more antibiotic-resistant bacteria have emerged as fatal threats to human beings  At present  more than 700 000 patients die every year with bacterial infections because of the lack of effective treatment  It is frustrating that the pace of development of antibiotics lags far behind that of bacterial resistance  with an estimation of 10 million deaths per year from bacterial infections after 2050  Facing such a rigorous challenge  approaches for bacterial disinfection are urgently demanded  The recently developed near-infrared  NIR  light-irradiation-based bacterial disinfection is highly promising to shatter bacterial resistance by employing NIR light-responsive materials as mediums to generate antibacterial factors such as heat  reactive oxygen species  ROS   and so on  This treatment approach is proved to be a potent candidate to accurately realize spatiotemporal control  while effectively eradicating multidrug-resistant bacteria and inhibiting antibiotic resistance  Herein  we summarize the latest progress of NIR light-based bacterial disinfection  Ultimately  current challenges and perspectives in this field are discussed,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35006816
Advances in Facemasks during the COVID-19 Pandemic Era,The outbreak of coronavirus disease  COVID-19  has transformed the daily lifestyles of people worldwide  COVID-19 was characterized as a pandemic owing to its global spread  and technologies based on engineered materials that help to reduce the spread of infections have been reported  Nanotechnology present in materials with enhanced physicochemical properties and versatile chemical functionalization offer numerous ways to combat the disease  Facemasks are a reliable preventive measure  although they are not 100  effective against viral infections  Nonwoven materials  which are the key components of masks  act as barriers to the virus through filtration  However  there is a high chance of cross-infection because the used mask lacks virucidal properties and can become an additional source of infection  The combination of antiviral and filtration properties enhances the durability and reliability of masks  thereby reducing the likelihood of cross-infection  In this review  we focus on masks  from the manufacturing stage to practical applications  and their abilities to combat COVID-19  Herein  we discuss the impacts of masks on the environment  while considering safe industrial production in the future  Furthermore  we discuss available options for future research directions that do not negatively impact the environment,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35006814
Nanostrategies to Develop Current Antiviral Vaccines,Infectious diseases are a worldwide concern  They are responsible for increasing the mortality rate and causing economic and social problems  Viral epidemics and pandemics  such as the COVID-19 pandemic  force the scientific community to consider molecules with antiviral activity  A number of viral infections still do not have a vaccine or efficient treatment and it is imperative to search for vaccines to control these infections  In this context  nanotechnology in association with the design of vaccines has presented an option for virus control  Nanovaccines have displayed an impressive immune response using a low dosage  This review aims to describe the advances and update the data in studies using nanovaccines and their immunomodulatory effect against human viruses,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35006813
Aligner-Mediated Cleavage-Based Isothermal Amplification for SARS-CoV-2 RNA Detection,Rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA is critical for reducing the global transmission of COVID-19  Here  we report a simple and versatile assay for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA based on aligner-mediated cleavage-based strand displacement amplification  AMC-SDA   The entire amplification procedure takes less than 25 min without professional instruments or requirement of specific target sequences and can reach a limit of detection of attomolar RNA concentration  Using pseudovirus as mimicry of clinical SARS-CoV-2 positive samples  we achieved a diagnostic accuracy of 100  in 10 simulated samples  five positive and five negative   We anticipate that our method will provide a universal platform for rapid and accurate detection of emerging infectious diseases,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35006810
Nanometer-Thick Superhydrophobic Coating Renders Cloth Mask Potentially Effective against Aerosol-Driven Infections,The advent of COVID-19 pandemic has made it necessary to wear masks across populations  While the N95 mask offers great performance against airborne infections  its multilayered sealed design makes it difficult to breathe for a longer duration of use  The option of using highly breathable cloth or silk masks especially for a large populace is fraught with the danger of infection  As a normal cloth or silk mask absorbs airborne liquid  it can be a source of plausible infection  We demonstrate the chemical modification of one such mask  Eri silk  to make it hydrophobic  contact angle of water is 143 7 degrees    which reduces the liquid absorption capacity without reducing the breathability of the mask significantly  The breathability reduces only 22  for hydrophobic Eri silk compared to the pristine Eri silk  whereas N95 shows a 59  reduction of breathability  The modified hydrophobic silk can repel the incoming aqueous liquid droplets without wetting the surface  The results indicate that a multilayered modified silk mask to make it hydrophobic can be an affordable and breathable alternative to the N95 mask,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35006773
Nanoceutical Fabric Prevents COVID-19 Spread through Expelled Respiratory Droplets  A Combined Computational  Spectroscopic  and Antimicrobial Study,Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  CDC  warns the use of one-way valves or vents in face masks for potential threat of spreading COVID-19 through expelled respiratory droplets  Here  we have developed a nanoceutical cotton fabric duly sensitized with non-toxic zinc oxide nanomaterial for potential use as a membrane filter in the one-way valve for the ease of breathing without the threat of COVID-19 spreading  A detailed computational study revealed that zinc oxide nanoflowers  ZnO NFs  with almost two-dimensional petals trap SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins  responsible to attach to ACE-2 receptors in human lung epithelial cells  The study also confirmed significant denaturation of the spike proteins on the ZnO surface  revealing removal of the virus upon efficient trapping  Following the computational study  we have synthesized ZnO NF on a cotton matrix using a hydrothermal-assisted strategy  Electron-microscopic  steady-state  and picosecond-resolved spectroscopic studies confirm attachment of ZnO NF to the cotton  i e   cellulose  matrix at the atomic level to develop the nanoceutical fabric  A detailed antimicrobial assay using Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria  model SARS-CoV-2 mimic  reveals excellent antimicrobial efficiency of the developed nanoceutical fabric  To our understanding  the nanoceutical fabric used in the one-way valve of a face mask would be the choice to assure breathing comfort along with source control of COVID-19 infection  The developed nanosensitized cloth can also be used as an antibacterial anti CoV-2 washable dress material in general,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35006728
Development of Triboelectroceutical Fabrics for Potential Applications in Self-Sanitizing Personal Protective Equipment,Attachment of microbial bodies including the corona virus on the surface of personal protective equipment  PPE  is found to be potential threat of spreading infection  Here  we report the development of a triboelectroceutical fabric  TECF  consisting of commonly available materials  namely  nylon and silicone rubber  SR   for the fabrication of protective gloves on the nitrile platform as model wearable PPE  A small triboelectric device  2 cm x 2 cm  consisting of SR and nylon on nitrile can generate more than 20 V transient or 41 muW output power  which is capable of charging a capacitor up to 65 V in only approximately 50 s  The importance of the present work relies on the TECF-led antimicrobial activity through the generation of an electric current in saline water  The fabrication of TECF-based functional prototype gloves can generate hypochlorite ions through the formation of electrolyzed water upon rubbing them with saline water  Further  computational modelling has been employed to reveal the optimum structure and mechanistic pathway of antimicrobial hypochlorite generation  Detailed antimicrobial assays have been performed to establish effectiveness of such TECF-based gloves to reduce the risk from life-threatening pathogen spreading  The present work provides the rationale to consider the studied TECF  or other materials with comparable properties  as a material of choice for the development of self-sanitizing PPE in the fight against microbial infections including COVID-19,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35006721
Stroke  Primary Prevention,Stroke is a leading cause of long-term disability in adults and the fifth leading cause of mortality in the United States  One of the main tasks related to stroke in the family medicine setting is assessment and management of modifiable risk factors  The American Heart Association American Stroke Association  AHA ASA  guidelines on primary prevention of stroke recommend that cigarette smoking  physical inactivity  overweight and obesity  dyslipidemia  hypertension  and diabetes be addressed and or managed to decrease the risk of stroke  Obstructive sleep apnea  OSA  is an independent risk factor for stroke  Screening for OSA in patients at risk of stroke can be considered  Atrial fibrillation  AF  contributes to more than 20  of acute ischemic strokes  Guidelines recommend that some patients with AF be treated with warfarin or direct-acting oral anticoagulants for stroke prevention  as the clinical situation warrants  Other risk factors for stroke include carotid artery disease  migraine with aura  sickle cell disease  alcohol or drug use  hypercoagulable states  including COVID-19   and previous stroke or transient ischemic attack  Recent meta-analyses have found that aspirin may not be beneficial for primary prevention of stroke  Aspirin currently is not recommended for primary stroke prevention in low-risk individuals,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35006660
COVID-19 pandemic impact on cytopathology practice in the post-lockdown period  An international  multicenter study,BACKGROUND  In a previous worldwide survey  the authors showed a drastic reduction in the number of cytological specimens processed during the coronavirus disease 2019  lockdown  period along with an increase in malignancy rates  To assess the continued impact of the pandemic on cytological practices around the world  they undertook a second follow-up worldwide survey collecting data from the post-lockdown period  2020   METHODS  Participants were asked to provide data regarding their cytopathology activity during the first 12 weeks of their respective national post-lockdown period  2020   which ranged from April 4 to October 31  Differences between the post-lockdown period and the corresponding 2019 period were evaluated  and the authors specifically focused on rates of malignant diagnoses  RESULTS  A total of 29 respondents from 17 countries worldwide joined the survey  Overall  a lower number of cytological specimens  n   236 352  were processed in comparison with the same period in 2019  n   321 466  for a relative reduction of 26 5   The overall malignancy rate showed a statistically significant increase  12 442  5 26   vs 12 882  4 01    P <  001  during the same time period  Similar results were obtained if both malignancy and suspicious for malignancy rates were considered together  15 759  6 58   vs 16 011  4 98    P <  001   CONCLUSIONS  The data showed a persistent reduction in the cytological specimen volume during the post-lockdown period  2020   However  the relative increase in the cytological workload in the late part of the post-lockdown is a promising finding of a slow return to normality,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35006650
Why science education is more important than most scientists think,The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed that a shockingly large fraction of the public is willing to ignore scientific judgements on issues such a vaccines and mask wearing  For far too many  scientific findings are viewed as what scientists believe  rather than as the product of an elaborate community process that produces reliable knowledge  This widespread misunderstanding should serve as a wake-up call for scientists  clearly demonstrating that the standard way that we teach science - as a large collection of  facts  that scientists have discovered about the world - needs major change  Three more ambitious and important goals for science education at all levels are outlined  In order of increasing difficulty  these are   1  to provide all adults with an ability to investigate scientific problems as scientists do  using logic  experiment  and evidence   2  to provide all adults with an understanding of how the scientific enterprise works - and why they should therefore trust the consensus judgements of science on issues like smoking  vaccination  and climate change  and  3  to provide all adults with the habit of solving their everyday problems as scientists do  using logic  experiment  and evidence  Although examples exist for attaining all of these goals  extensive education research will be needed to discover how best to teach the last two  I argue that such an effort is urgent  and that it can best begin by focusing on the introductory courses in biology and other science disciplines at the university level,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35006607
Family Medicine and Emergency Redeployment  Unrealized Potential,BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES  Discussions of scope of practice among family physicians has become a crucial topic amidst the COVID-19 pandemic  coupled with new attention to residency training requirements  Family medicine has seen a gradual narrowing of practice due to a host of issues  including physician choice  expanding scope of practice from physician assistants and nurses  an increased emphasis on patient volume  clinical revenue  and residency training competency requirements  We sought to demonstrate the flexibility of the family medicine workforce as shown through their scopes of practice  and argue that this is indication of their potential for redeployment during emergencies  METHODS  This study computes scopes of practice for 78 416 family physicians who treat Medicare beneficiaries  We used Evaluation and Management  E M  codes in Medicare s 2017 Part-B public use file to calculate volumes of services done across six sites of service per physician  We aggregated counts and proportions of physicians and the E M services they provided across sites of practice to characterize scope  and performed a separate analysis on rural physicians  RESULTS  The study found most family physicians practicing at a single site  namely  the ambulatory clinic  However  family physicians in rural areas  where need is greater  exhibit broader scope  This suggests that a significant number of family physicians have capacity for COVID-19 deployment into other settings  such as emergency rooms or hospitals  CONCLUSIONS  Family physicians are a potential resource for emergency redeployment  however the current breadth of scope for most family physicians is not aligned with current residency training requirements and raises questions about the future of family medicine scope of practice,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35006599
Meeting case investigation and contact tracing needs during COVID-19 in Alberta  the development and implementation of the Alberta Health Services Pod Partnership Model,SETTING  In Alberta  a small team of specialized public health experts typically complete case investigation and contact tracing  High COVID-19 case counts and a shortage of trained public health professionals required a rapid and significant adaptation of staffing models to meet the population s needs  INTERVENTION  A tiered  interdisciplinary staffing model  based on those in critical care  was developed  piloted  and implemented in the Alberta Health Services  Communicable Disease Control department in late 2020 to complete case investigation and contact tracing  The final model included novice  non-regulated professionals divided into pods of four to six investigators  led by an experienced regulated investigator  Team leads oversaw five pods  Communicable disease nurses provided an additional tier of clinical expertise  During the model development  roles and responsibilities of team members were delineated  ratios for supervision were tested  and rapid training was provided  OUTCOMES  The tiered staffing model began in November 2020 with staff members in two pods  At its peak in early May 2021  72 pods of 502 non-regulated members  134 regulated investigators  and 4 communicable disease nurses completed 780-973 case investigations daily  or 40-45  of all positive cases in Alberta  In comparison  the same number of regulated investigators working independently in the traditional staffing model without non-regulated pods completed  on average  249 case investigations daily  IMPLICATIONS  A tiered staffing model can be effective at maximizing the skills of the experienced members of the case investigation team to maintain case investigation and contact tracing activities during a pandemic,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35006591
Comparison of door-to-balloon time and in-hospital outcomes in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction between before versus after COVID-19 pandemic,The situation around primary percutaneous coronary intervention  PCI  has dramatically changed since coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  pandemic  The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on clinical outcomes as well as door-to-balloon time  DTBT   which is known as one of the indicators of early reperfusion  has not been fully investigated in patients with ST-elevation acute myocardial infarction  STEMI   The purpose of this study was to compare DTBT and in-hospital outcomes in patients with STEMI between before versus after COVID-19 pandemic  The primary interest was DTBT and the incidence of in-hospital outcomes including in-hospital death  We included 330 patients with STEMI who underwent primary PCI  and divided them into the pre COVID-19 group  n   209  and the post COVID-19 group  n   121   DTBT was significantly longer in the post COVID-19 group than in the pre COVID-19 group  p < 0 001   whereas the incidence of in-hospital death was comparable between the 2 groups  p   0 238   In the multivariate logistic regression analysis  chest CT before primary PCI  OR 4 64  95  CI 2 58-8 34  p < 0 001  was significantly associated with long DTBT  whereas chest CT before primary PCI  OR 0 76  95  CI 0 29-1 97  p   0 570  was not associated with in-hospital death after controlling confounding factors  In conclusion  although DTBT was significantly longer after COVID-19 pandemic than before COVID-19 pandemic  in-hospital outcomes were comparable between before versus after COVID-19 pandemic  This study suggests the validity of the screening tests including chest CT for COVID-19 in patients with STEMI who undergo primary PCI,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35006544
Estimating COVID-19-induced excess mortality in Lombardy  Italy,We compare the expected all-cause mortality with the observed one for different age classes during the pandemic in Lombardy  which was the epicenter of the epidemic in Italy  The first case in Italy was found in Lombardy in early 2020  and the first wave was mainly centered in Lombardy  The other three waves  in Autumn 2020  March 2021 and Summer 2021 are also characterized by a high number of cases in absolute terms  A generalized linear mixed model is introduced to model weekly mortality from 2011 to 2019  taking into account seasonal patterns and year-specific trends  Based on the 2019 year-specific conditional best linear unbiased predictions  a significant excess of mortality is estimated in 2020  leading to approximately 35000 more deaths than expected  mainly arising during the first wave  In 2021  instead  the excess mortality is not significantly different from zero  for the 85  and 15-64 age classes  and significant reductions with respect to the 2020 estimated excess mortality are estimated for other age classes,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35006542
The discovery of herbal drugs and natural compounds as inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro,The emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  pandemic in 2019 has led to a global health crisis  Mutations of the SARS-CoV-2 genome have impeded the development of effective therapeutics and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2  Natural products are important for discovering therapeutics to treat the 2019 coronavirus disease  COVID-19   In the present study  we investigated the antiviral activity of herbal drug extracts from Polygala Root  Areca  and Quercus Bark and natural compounds derived from herbal drug such as baicalin and glabridin  with IC50 values of 9 5 microg ml  1 2 microg ml  5 4 microg ml  8 8 microM  and 2 5 microM  respectively  against SARS CoV-2 infection in vitro  Certain herbal drug extracts and natural compounds were found to inhibit viral RNA levels and infectious titers of SARS-CoV-2 in a dose-dependent manner  Furthermore  viral protein analyses showed that herbal drug extracts and natural compounds effectively inhibited SARS-CoV-2 in the various entry treatments  Our study revealed that three herbal drugs are good candidates for further in vivo and clinical studies,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35006524
Successful application of pulsed electromagnetic fields in a patient with post-COVID-19 fatigue  a case report,BACKGROUND  Post-COVID-19 fatigue is a frequent symptom in COVID-19 survivors  which substantially limits patients to achieve full recovery and potentially restrains return to work  The previous literature has not yet reported the use of pulsed electromagnetic fields in this indication  METHODS  Over the course of 5 weeks  10 sessions of pulsed electromagnetic field treatment with a high magnetic flux density were applied to a patient suffering from post-COVID-19 fatigue syndrome  Fatigue  work ability  quality of life as well as anxiety  depression  stress level  and resilience were evaluated using validated patient-reported outcome measures  RESULTS  Fatigue  work ability  quality of life  and psychological well-being improved clearly over the course of the treatment and showed stable results 6 weeks later  CONCLUSION  The use of pulsed electromagnetic field therapy with a device that allows sufficient penetration of the body tissue might be a promising physical modality to manage post-COVID-19 fatigue syndrome  which could reduce clinical and economic health consequences  Clinical sham-controlled studies are needed to evaluate the effect of pulsed electromagnetic fields in this indication,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35006516
Effects of 6-month episodic future thinking training on delay discounting  weight loss and HbA1c changes in individuals with prediabetes,People with prediabetes are at risk for type 2 diabetes  They may discount the future delay discounting  DD   and not engage in preventive health behaviors  Episodic future thinking  EFT  can reduce DD when future scenarios are cued  but research is needed to assess long-term effects of EFT and when EFT is not cued  This study tested EFT training compared to control for people with prediabetes enrolled in a 6-month weight loss program on DD  weight  HbA1c  and physical activity  Results showed a reliable EFT effect on reducing DD in cued  p   0 0035   and uncued DD tasks  p   0 048   and significant overall changes in weight  p < 0 001   HbA1c  p  0 001  and physical activity  p   0 003   but no significant differences in these outcomes by group  p s > 0 05   Sixty-eight percent of the sample ended below the prediabetes HbA1c range  These results suggest that DD can be modified over extended periods  and the effects of EFT can be observed without EFT cues  However  these data do not suggest that changes in weight  HbA1c or physical activity were due to EFT training  The study was initiated before the COVID-19 pandemic which provided the opportunity to compare differences for people treated in-person or remotely  Analyses showed no differences in DD  weight  HBA1c or physical activity outcomes were observed between in-person and remote treatment  suggesting telehealth is a scalable approach to treating prediabetes,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35006500

Update on treatment and preventive interventions against COVID-19  an overview of potential pharmacological agents and vaccines,The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  triggered by the new member of the coronaviridae family  severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2   has created an unprecedented challenge for global health  In addition to mild to moderate clinical manifestations such as fever  cough  and fatigue  severe cases often developed lethal complications including acute respiratory distress syndrome  ARDS  and acute lung injury  Given the alarming rate of infection and increasing trend of mortality  the development of underlying therapeutic and preventive treatment  as well as the verification of its effectiveness  are the top priorities  Current research mainly referred to and evaluated the application of the empirical treatment based on two precedents  severe acute respiratory syndrome  SARS  and Middle East respiratory syndrome  MERS   including antiviral drugs targeting different stages of virus replication  immunotherapy modulating the overactivated inflammation response  and other therapies such as herbal medicine and mesenchymal stem cells  Besides  the ongoing development of inventing prophylactic interventions such as various vaccines by companies and institutions worldwide is crucial to decline morbidity and mortality  This review mainly focused on promising candidates for the treatment of COVID-19 and collected recently updated evidence relevant to its feasibility in clinical practice in the near future,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35006461
Systematic review of risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and severity of COVID-19 with therapies approved to treat multiple sclerosis,There is growing concern that multiple sclerosis  MS  patients on certain therapies may be at higher risk for severe coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19   We conducted a systematic literature review to examine the available data on U S  therapies approved to treat MS and the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection or severe COVID-19 outcomes  We conducted searches in PubMed  Embase  and the WHO COVID-19 database through May 2  2021  and retrieved articles describing clinical data on therapies approved to treat MS and the risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 or the effects of such therapies on clinical outcomes of COVID-19  The literature search identified a total of 411 articles  97 in PubMed  227 in Embase  and 87 in the WHO database  After excluding duplicates and screening  we identified 15 articles of interest  We identified an additional article through a broader secondary weekly search in PubMed  Thus  ultimately  we reviewed 16 observational studies  Available data  which suggest that MS patients treated with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies may be at increased risk for severe COVID-19  are subject to relevant limitations  Generally  studies did not identify increased risk for COVID-19 worsening with other therapies approved to treat MS  Based on observational data  biological plausibility  novelty of the drug-event association  and public health implications in a subpopulation with potential impaired response to the COVID-19 vaccines  this safety signal merits further monitoring,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35006442
Fast and long-lasting immune response to S-trimer COVID-19 vaccine adjuvanted by PIKA,In the face of the emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2  there is an urgent need to develop a vaccine that can induce fast  effective  long-lasting and broad protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2  Here  we developed a trimeric SARS-CoV-2 S protein vaccine candidate adjuvanted by PIKA  which can induce robust cellular and humoral immune responses  The results showed a high level of neutralizing antibodies induced by the vaccine was maintained for at least 400 days  In the study of non-human primates  PIKA adjuvanted S-trimer induced high SARS-CoV-2 neutralization titers and protected from virus replication in the lung following SARS-CoV-2 challenge  In addition  the long-term neutralizing antibody response induced by S-trimer vaccine adjuvanted by PIKA could neutralize multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants and there is no obvious different among the SARS- CoV-2 variants of interest or concern  including B 1 351  B 1 1 7  P 1  B 1 617 1 and B 1 617 2 variants  These data support the utility of S-trimer protein adjuvanted by PIKA as a potential vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2 infection,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35006430
Computationally repurposed drugs and natural products against RNA dependent RNA polymerase as potential COVID-19 therapies,Repurposing of existing drugs and drug candidates is an ideal approach to identify new potential therapies for SARS-CoV-2 that can be tested without delay in human trials of infected patients  Here we applied a virtual screening approach using Autodock Vina and molecular dynamics simulation in tandem to calculate binding energies for repurposed drugs against the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase  RdRp   We thereby identified 80 promising compounds with potential activity against SARS-Cov2  consisting of a mixture of antiviral drugs  natural products and drugs with diverse modes of action  A substantial proportion of the top 80 compounds identified in this study had been shown by others to have SARS-CoV-2 antiviral effects in vitro or in vivo  thereby validating our approach  Amongst our top hits not previously reported to have SARS-CoV-2 activity  were eribulin  a macrocyclic ketone analogue of the marine compound halichondrin B and an anticancer drug  the AXL receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor bemcentinib  Our top hits from our RdRp drug screen may not only have utility in treating COVID-19 but may provide a useful starting point for therapeutics against other coronaviruses  Hence  our modelling approach successfully identified multiple drugs with potential activity against SARS-CoV-2 RdRp,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35006427
Low dose of emetine as potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 virus therapy  preclinical in vitro inhibition and in vivo pharmacokinetic evidences,The global pandemic of COVID-19 has attracted extensive drug searching interets for the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2  Although currently several of clinically used  old  drugs have been repurposed to this new disease for the urgent clinical investigation  there is still great demand for more effective therapies for the anti-infections  Here we report the discovery that an  old  drug Emetine could potently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 virus replication and displayed virus entry blocking effect in Vero cells at low dose  In addition  Emetine could significantly reduce the lipopolysaccharide  LPS  induced interleukin-6  IL-6  protein level and moderately reduce the tumor necrosis factor  TNF-alpha  protein level in the M1 polarized THP-1 macrophages  In vivo animal pharmacokinetics  PK  study revealed that Emetine was enriched in the lung tissue and had a long retention time  over 12 h   With 1 mg kg single oral dose  the effective concentration of Emetine in lung was up to 1 8 muM  mice  and 1 6 muM  rats  at 12 h  which is over 200-fold higher than the EC50 of the drug  The potent in vitro antiviral replication efficacy and the high enrichment in target tissue  combining with the well documented safety profiles in human indicate that low dose of Emetine might be a potentially effective anti-SARS-CoV-2 infection therapy,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35006425
COVID-19  insights into virus-receptor interactions,The recent outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019  COVID-19  calls for rapid mobilization of scientists to probe and explore solutions to this deadly disease  A limited understanding of the high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2  Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  relative to other coronavirus strains guides a deeper investigation into the virus receptor interactions  The cutting-edge studies in thermodynamic and kinetic properties of interactions such as protein-protein interplays have been reviewed in many modeling and analysis studies  Highlighting the thermodynamic assessments of biological interactions and emphasizing the boosted transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 despite its high similarity in structure and sequence with other coronavirus strains is an important and highly valuable investigation that can lead scientists to discover analytical and fundamental approaches in studying virus s interactions  Accordingly  we have attempted to describe the crucial factors such as conformational changes and hydrophobicity particularities that influence on thermodynamic potentials in the SARS-COV-2 S-protein adsorption process  Discussing the thermodynamic potentials and the kinetics of the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein in its interaction with the ACE2 receptors of the host cell is a fundamental approach that would be extremely valuable in designing candidate pharmaceutical agents or exploring alternative treatments,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35006423
Structural basis for the multimerization of nonstructural protein nsp9 from SARS-CoV-2,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2  SARS-CoV-2   the causative agent of a potentially fatal disease named coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19   has raised significant public health concerns globally  To date  the COVID-19 pandemic has caused millions of people to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 worldwide  It has been known since the 2003 SARS epidemic that coronaviruses  CoVs  have large RNA genomes  the replication of which requires an RNA-dependent RNA replication transcription complex  CoV nonstructural proteins  Nsps  play pivotal roles in the assembly of this complex and associated enzymatic functions in virus genomic replication  Several smaller nonenzymatic Nsps assist with RNA-dependent RNA polymerase function  In this study  we determined the structure of SARS-CoV-2 nonstructural protein 9  nsp9   an RNA-binding protein that is essential for CoV replication  Its homotetrameric structure with two stable dimeric interfaces provids a structural basis for understanding the mechanisms of RNA-binding protein self-assembly  which may be essential for the regulation of viral RNA replication and transcription,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35006420
Immunological perspectives on the pathogenesis  diagnosis  prevention and treatment of COVID-19,Coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  is an acute respiratory disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-COV-2   COVID-19 can spread to the entire body and cause multiple organ failure  It is a daunting challenge to control the fast growing worldwide pandemic because effective prevention and treatment strategies are unavailable currently  Generally  the immune response of the human body triggered by viral infection is essential for the elimination of the virus  However  severe COVID-19 patients may manifest dysregulated immune responses  such as lymphopenia  lymphocyte exhaustion  exacerbated antibody response  cytokine release syndrome  CRS   etc  Understanding of these immunological characteristics may help identify better approaches for diagnosis  prognosis and treatment of COVID-19 patients  As specific anti-viral agents are notoriously difficult to develop  strategies for modulating the immune responses by either developing novel vaccines or using immunotherapy hold great promise to improve the management of SARS-CoV-2 infection,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35006419
Worry from contracting COVID-19 infection and its stigma among Egyptian health care providers,BACKGROUNDS  Healthcare providers  HCPs  in COVID-19 epidemic face stressful workload of disease management  shortage of protective equipment and high risk of infection and mortality  These stressors affect greatly their mental health  The aim is to identify working conditions among Egyptian HCPs during COVID-19 epidemic as well as stigma and worry perceptions from contracting COVID-19 infection and their predictors  METHODS  A cross-sectional study was conducted among 565 HCPs  Data was collected through Google online self-administered questionnaire comprised seven parts  demographics characteristics  knowledge and attitude of COVID-19  working condition  worry of contracting COVID-19 at work  discrimination intention at work for COVID-19 patients  stigma assessment using impact stigma  and internalized shame scales  RESULTS  The vast majority of HCPs  94 7   were worried from contracting COVID-19 at work  Risk factors for perceiving severe worry from contracting COVID-19 were expecting infection as a severe illness  believing that infection will not be successfully controlled  improbability to continue working during the pandemic even if in a well fit health  high discrimination intention and impact stigma scales  Significantly high impact stigma scores were detected among those aged < 30 years  females  workers primarily in sites susceptible for contracting COVID-19 infection  those had severe worry from contracting infection at work  and high internalized shame scale  The risk factors for perceiving higher internalized shame scores were not having a previous experience in working during a pandemic  high discrimination intention towards COVID-19 patients and high impact stigma scale  CONCLUSIONS  Considerable levels of worry and stigma were detected among Egyptian HCPs during COVID-19 outbreak  The psychological aspect of health care providers should not be overlooked during epidemic  appropriate institutional mental health support should be provided especially for young HCPs  those without previous work experience in epidemic and those who work in high-risk units  Raising the community awareness about contribution of HCPs in fighting the epidemic might decrease stigmatization action toward HCPs,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35006408
Multimodality molecular imaging of the alveolar-capillary barrier in lung disease using albumin based optical and PET tracers,Inflammatory changes caused by viruses  bacteria  exposure to toxins  commonly used drugs and even surgical intervention have the potential of causing abnormal epithelial permeability  which is manifest as infiltrative processes on computed tomography  CT   including the widespread infiltrates seen in COVID-19 pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome  ARDS   We utilized a previously published mouse model of ARDS  intranasal delivery of LPS  to induce the alveolar-capillary barrier permeability seen in lung disease  We intravenously injected mice with Cy7 or 68-Gallium   68 Ga  labeled mouse albumin and imaged using optical imaging  OI  CT and PET  We observed significantly increased lung levels of Cy7-albumin on 3D OI CT  which matched the abnormal appearance on microCT  This uptake correlated with fluorescence seen on sectioned lungs  To examine the translational potential of these findings  we radiolabeled albumin with  68 Ga  We found that in mice with LPS-induced lung injury   68 Ga-albumin PET correlated with our optical imaging findings and demonstrated abnormal activity in the lung fields  indicative of abnormal epithelial permeability  These findings indicate  68 Ga-albumin can be utilized as a sensitive translational radiotracer for quantifying the abnormal epithelial permeability that is seen in various lung pathologies  including COVID-19 induced pneumonia and ARDS  The ability to use Cy7-albumin 3D OI CT imaging as a preclinical translational surrogate for  68 Ga-albumin offers an accessible high throughput means to rapidly screen potential therapeutics against lung diseases that clinically manifest with endothelial permeability,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35006404

Evaluation of views and perceptions of the medical faculty students about distance anatomy education during the COVID-19 pandemic,PURPOSE  This study aimed to investigate the students  opinions about the distance anatomy education given in our faculty at the COVID-19 pandemic and present our department s experiences  METHODS  An online questionnaire designed for medical faculty students  The questionnaire was applied to 355 volunteer medical faculty students  The questionnaire consisted of demographics  five-point Likert items  and open-ended questions  The questionnaire was applied between August and September 2020  Distance anatomy education activities were evaluated during March and July 2020  RESULTS  Results showed face-to-face theoretical anatomy education was found to be more effective than distance anatomy education conducted with recorded lecture videos  Even though the positive aspects of distance anatomy education stand out in topics  such as time management  it has been stated that cadaver and laboratory education has been disrupted  Most of the students agreed that they spent more time on supplementary resources during distance anatomy education  CONCLUSION  The COVID-19 pandemic has provided an unexpected experimental environment  The demand for a blended method  which consists of distance  supported by video recordings  theoretical anatomy education and face-to-face practical anatomy education for the post-pandemic period comes to the fore  Distance anatomy education brings some problems with it due to its nature  and it is essential to seek unique solutions to them  Evaluating the perceptions of the parties will play an essential role in solving the problems of distance anatomy education and in the formation of future anatomy education styles,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35006291
Immunoinformatics prediction of potential immunodominant epitopes from human coronaviruses and association with autoimmunity,Cross-reactivity between different human coronaviruses  HCoVs  might contribute to COVID-19 outcomes  Here  we aimed to predict conserved peptides among different HCoVs that could elicit cross-reacting B cell and T cell responses  Three hundred fifty-one full-genome sequences of HCoVs  including SARS-CoV-2  51   SARS-CoV-1  50   MERS-CoV  50   and common cold species OC43  50   NL63  50   229E  50   and HKU1  50  were downloaded aligned using Geneious Prime 20 20  Identification of epitopes in the conserved regions of HCoVs was carried out using the Immune Epitope Database  IEDB  to predict B- and T-cell epitopes  Further  we identified sequences that bind multiple common MHC and modeled the three-dimensional structures of the protein regions  The search yielded 73 linear and 35 discontinuous epitopes  A total of 16 B-cell and 19 T-cell epitopes were predicted through a comprehensive bioinformatic screening of conserved regions derived from HCoVs  The 16 potentially cross-reactive B-cell epitopes included 12 human proteins and four viral proteins among the linear epitopes  Likewise  we identified 19 potentially cross-reactive T-cell epitopes covering viral proteins  Interestingly  two conserved regions  LSFVSLAICFVIEQF  NSP2  and VVHSVNSLVSSMEVQSL  spike   contained several matches that were described epitopes for SARS-CoV  Most of the predicted B cells were buried within the SARS-CoV-2 protein regions  functional domains  whereas T-cell stretched close to the functional domains  Additionally  most SARS-CoV-2 predicted peptides  80   bound to different HLA types associated with autoimmune diseases  We identified a set of potential B cell and T cell epitopes derived from the HCoVs that could contribute to different diseases manifestation  including autoimmune disorders,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35006282
Association of a Third Dose of BNT162b2 Vaccine With Incidence of SARS-CoV-2 Infection Among Health Care Workers in Israel,Importance  Administration of a BNT162b2 booster dose  Pfizer-BioNTech  to fully vaccinated individuals aged 60 years and older was significantly associated with lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe illness  Data are lacking on the effectiveness of booster doses for younger individuals and health care workers  Objective  To estimate the association of a BNT162b2 booster dose with SARS-CoV-2 infections among health care workers who were previously vaccinated with a 2-dose series of BNT162b2  Design  Setting  and Participants  This was a prospective cohort study conducted at a tertiary medical center in Tel Aviv  Israel  The study cohort included 1928 immunocompetent health care workers who were previously vaccinated with a 2-dose series of BNT162b2  and had enrolled between August 8 and 19  2021  with final follow-up reported through September 20  2021  Screening for SARS-CoV-2 infection was performed every 14 days  Anti-spike protein receptor binding domain IgG titers were determined at baseline and 1 month after enrollment  Cox regression with time-dependent analysis was used to estimate hazard ratios of SARS-CoV-2 infection between booster-immunized status and 2-dose vaccinated  booster-nonimmunized  status  Exposures  Vaccination with a booster dose of BNT162b2 vaccine  Main Outcomes and Measures  The primary outcome was SARS-CoV-2 infection  as confirmed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction  Results  Among 1928 participants  the median age was 44 years  IQR  36-52 years  and 1381 were women  71 6    Participants completed the 2-dose vaccination series a median of 210 days  IQR  205-213 days  before study enrollment  A total of 1650 participants  85 6   received the booster dose  During a median follow-up of 39 days  IQR  35-41 days   SARS-CoV-2 infection occurred in 44 participants  incidence rate  60 2 per 100000 person-days   31  70 5   were symptomatic  Five SARS-CoV-2 infections occurred in booster-immunized participants and 39 in booster-nonimmunized participants  incidence rate  12 8 vs 116 per 100000 person-days  respectively   In a time-dependent Cox regression analysis  the adjusted hazard ratio of SARS-CoV-2 infection for booster-immunized vs booster-nonimmunized participants was 0 07  95  CI  0 02-0 20   Conclusions and Relevance  Among health care workers at a single center in Israel who were previously vaccinated with a 2-dose series of BNT162b2  administration of a booster dose compared with not receiving one was associated with a significantly lower rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection over a median of 39 days of follow-up  Ongoing surveillance is required to assess durability of the findings,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35006256
Trajectory of Viral RNA Load Among Persons With Incident SARS-CoV-2 G614 Infection  Wuhan Strain  in Association With COVID-19 Symptom Onset and Severity,Importance  The SARS-CoV-2 viral trajectory has not been well characterized in incident infections  These data are needed to inform natural history  prevention practices  and therapeutic development  Objective  To characterize early SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA load  hereafter referred to as viral load  in individuals with incident infections in association with COVID-19 symptom onset and severity  Design  Setting  and Participants  This prospective cohort study was a secondary data analysis of a remotely conducted study that enrolled 829 asymptomatic community-based participants recently exposed  <96 hours  to persons with SARS-CoV-2 from 41 US states from March 31 to August 21  2020  Two cohorts were studied   1  participants who were SARS-CoV-2 negative at baseline and tested positive during study follow-up  and  2  participants who had 2 or more positive swabs during follow-up  regardless of the initial  baseline  swab result  Participants collected daily midturbinate swab samples for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection and maintained symptom diaries for 14 days  Exposure  Laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection  Main Outcomes and Measures  The observed SARS-CoV-2 viral load among incident infections was summarized  and piecewise linear mixed-effects models were used to estimate the characteristics of viral trajectories in association with COVID-19 symptom onset and severity  Results  A total of 97 participants  55 women  57    median age  37 years  IQR  27-52 years   developed incident infections during follow-up  Forty-two participants  43   had viral shedding for 1 day  median peak viral load cycle threshold  Ct  value  38 5  95  CI  38 3-39 0    18  19   for 2 to 6 days  median Ct value  36 7  95  CI  30 2-38 1    and 31  32   for 7 days or more  median Ct value  18 3  95  CI  17 4-22 0    The cycle threshold value has an inverse association with viral load  Six participants  6   had 1 to 6 days of viral shedding with censored duration  The peak mean  SD  viral load was observed on day 3 of shedding  Ct value  33 8  95  CI  31 9-35 6    Based on the statistical models fitted to 129 participants  60 men  47    median age  38 years  IQR  25-54 years   with 2 or more SARS-CoV-2-positive swab samples  persons reporting moderate or severe symptoms tended to have a higher peak mean viral load than those who were asymptomatic  Ct value  23 3  95  CI  22 6-24 0  vs 30 7  95  CI  29 8-31 4    Mild symptoms generally started within 1 day of peak viral load  and moderate or severe symptoms 2 days after peak viral load  All 535 sequenced samples detected the G614 variant  Wuhan strain   Conclusions and Relevance  This cohort study suggests that having incident SARS-CoV-2 G614 infection was associated with a rapid viral load peak followed by slower decay  COVID-19 symptom onset generally coincided with peak viral load  which correlated positively with symptom severity  This longitudinal evaluation of the SARS-CoV-2 G614 with frequent molecular testing serves as a reference for comparing emergent viral lineages to inform clinical trial designs and public health strategies to contain the spread of the virus,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35006245

P059 Impact of PHQ-9 Screen on Early Identification of Depression in IBD Clinic,BACKGROUND  Over the past two decades there has been significant research linking inflammatory bowel disease  IBD  to depression  The chronicity of symptoms coupled with the financial burden of treatment costs  missed days of work school and interpersonal relationship stress are contributing factors in the diagnosis of depression  The prevalence of depression within the IBD community is 15  and depressive symptoms are noted in 20  of patients  Furthermore  IBD patients with severe uncontrolled disease have higher rates of depression  40 7   than those in remission  16 5    The association between IBD and depression is linked to lower quality of life  poor medication compliance  worse disease outcomes  increased hospitalization  and higher suicidal risk  Early diagnosis and treatment of depression in IBD patients is paramount in achieving and maintaining IBD disease remission  While the association between IBD and depression is well-known  identifying depression can be a challenge  Review of recent literature shows that depression is under screened in IBD clinics  We present a prospective quality improvement study at a robust IBD center evaluating the impact of a validated depression screen  PHQ-9  on identifying depression compared to standard of care  METHODS  We compared the prevalence of depression in the IBD clinic in the control group using the history and diagnosis of depression and compared it against the intervention group after HQ-9 screening  Control group patient data was collected from June 2020 to July 2020 via virtual and in person visits  Intervention group PHQ-9 data was collected in person visits from January - March 2020 and post-intervention data collection was placed on hold until November 2020 due to the COVID pandemic  One randomly selected patient from each clinic session was asked to participate in the study at the time of visit  The primary end point was to compare the rates of depression and identify any barriers in providing early treatment for depression  The secondary endpoint was to identify high risk patients that are prone to depression  Categorical variables were analyzed by chi square analysis or fischer exact tests  Numerical data were analyzed using T-test  RESULTS  A total of 111 patients were screened  60 patients were randomized to the control group  i e  EMR based review for depression  and 51 patients were screened via survey during in person clinic visit  The identified depression rate from control vs intervention group is 20  vs  35   p   0 071   Rates of depression were 15  in non-fistulizing Crohn s disease vs  41 4  in fistulizing Crohn s disease  p   0 003   Multivariate model for predicting depression noted to be significant for extra-intestinal manifestations OR of 3 06  1 03  9 12  p   0 045 and age OR of 0 97  0 94  1 00  p   0 042  Control vs  intervention identification of depression in patients with extra-intestinal manifestations is notable for OR of 3 31  1 15  9 52  p   0 026 in the univariate model and OR of 3 30  1 07  10 16  p   0 038 in the multivariate model  CONCLUSION  Key findings including identification of depression is higher in the intervention group compared to the control group  Though the data is not statistically significant  this is likely secondary to the small sample size in the setting of the pandemic  In addition  univariate analysis revealed a statistically significant finding that the older the age of the patient  the less likely they are to have depression  Our data showed that the mean age of depressed patients was 38 3 compared to nondepressed patients whose mean age is 47 1  Further analysis can help elucidate this finding  for example identifying if older patients are being treated for depression or more likely to seek out therapists compared to younger patients  Univariate analysis also revealed that intestinal Crohn s disease was a risk factor for depression  This is possibly secondary to the severity of disease in these individuals  especially if their IBD is causing an impact on their quality of life  Looking into the number of hospitalizations  days off from work or school  and coexisting medical diagnoses can allow us to further understand if depression stems from their disease  Given preliminary findings  we plan to continue this study for a larger sample size and further determine if there is a significant delay in identifying depression with the current standard of care,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35006185
P054 IBD Associated Surveillance Dysplasia Program  New Integrated Model  Audit  Summary  Future Directions and Literature Review,BACKGROUND  The recommended commencement of screening for dysplasia in IBD cases is after 8-year duration with at least E2 disease  that is proximal to the rectosigmoid junction   approximately 15cm  or L2 or L3 Crohn s disease involving at least one-third of the colon  At this time  the risk of colonic IBD patients having CRC approaches 1   Exceptions   Early starters  people with a diagnosis of PSC with concurrent IBD suggest surveillance starts annually from the date of PSC diagnosis  Those with an FDR with CRC should commence screening 10 years prior to the age of diagnosis of the affected relative  Surveillance of the ileoanal pouch following restorative proctectomy is not commented on in the new guidelines  It is usually not recommended in the absence of high-risk features  ASGE  ECCO and BSG Guidelines   PSC diagnosis  CRC or dysplasia in the resected colon  Type C pouch mucosa or Refractory pouchitis  METHODS  The aim of the multidisciplinary team  MDT  is to improve the pathway for surveillance procedures  allocate resources appropriately and identify patients for research and trials  Cases were mainly referred from the prospective months booking database  Each case that is included in the monthly MDT meeting is discussed to ensure it is appropriate consistent with guidelines with the assistance of administrative and data managers  We collate the cases with IBD database and risk calculator  assess and prescribe bowel prep  record outcome and communicate any changes  identify patients for studies and ensure we allocate patients to appropriate endoscopy lists  RESULTS  Over a course of 12 meetings conducted monthly  a total of 356 cases were screened with 91 cases eligible of which 62 cases were considered suitable in meeting inclusion criteria  The majority of these cases were UC  E3 E2   n   56   Crohn s  n   27   colonic IBD  n   7  and IBD-U  n   1   The majority of cases were deemed in the high-risk category for colorectal cancer  43 62   Previous known dysplasia cases were limited  two cases with adenoma   There were 17 cases with PSC  seven were large duct   Family history of dysplasia was not strongly represented  Ten new cases of PSC being investigated were identified early prior to hepatology review or critical investigations  There were ten pouchscopy cases  There were a significant number of deferrals  cancellations and reassignments identified  n   16   Four procedures were cancelled  eight cases reassigned due to extensive pseudo polyps and 17 were placed on PSC annual surveillance  We also identified significant bowel prep deficiencies in 18 cases requiring prescriptions  IE or chromoendoscopy was identified as a potential area of improvement  A three-point specified allocation to colonoscopy lists was lacking  possibly mainly due to COVID 19 backlog of cases  The areas of improvement included attracting referrals from other settings other than the monthly booking file data  e g hepatology clinic  and improving long-term attendance  CONCLUSION  The IBD surveillance MDT is a clinically useful tool that demonstrates significant improvement in quality and procedure reallocation  Although resource allocation is required  this clinical model can ensure that all IBD dysplasia surveillance cases including those with challenging risk factors or those outside the evidence based guidelines are appropriately monitored,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35006181
P034 State of Health Maintenance Among IBD Patients at a Tertiary Care Center in Abu Dhabi  United Arab Emirates,BACKGROUND  Crohn s disease  CD  and ulcerative colitis  UC  are inflammatory bowel diseases  IBD  affecting 6 8 million persons globally  Treatment of IBD focuses largely on immune suppression or modulation using corticosteroids  aminosalicylates  thiopurines  or biologic agents  These agents are effective but most of them pose a risk of infections  cancers  and osteoporosis  Many of these complications can be prevented by implementing vaccination  cancer screening  and bone health programs  Despite the progress in IBD care  recent data suggest that many IBD patients do not get preventative services  Previous studies have examined rates of vaccinations and other health maintenance metrics in North America and Europe where IBD patients are mainly of European and African descent  In comparison  Middle Eastern and Asian descent persons comprise the majority of the IBD population in Abu Dhabi  the capital city of United Arab Emirates  UAE   a major country in the Gulf region of the Middle East  Little is known to date about the state of IBD preventative care in this region  We sought to assess the proportion of patients with IBD that underwent recommended vaccinations  cancer screening  surveillance colonoscopy  PAP smear  annual skin examination   and bone health evaluation at Sheikh Shakhbout Medical City  SSMC   the largest tertiary care hospital in Abu Dhabi  METHODS  This study was a retrospective case series of adult IBD patients  >18 years  seen in the outpatient setting at SSMC from 2019 to 2020  Patients were identified based on ICD-10 codes for IBD  K50 90  K50 00  K51 90  and K50 80  as well as administrative pharmacy records of the IBD agents  e g  infliximab   Proportions were assessed using simple summary statistics and one sample proportion 95  confidence intervals were calculated  RESULTS  A total of 55 IBD patients were identified in our study with the majority being males  76 3    The mean age was 31 6 years  Sixty-nine percent had Crohn s  Most of the patients were on infliximab  58 1    followed by vedolizumab  ustekinumab  and adalimumab  The proportion of patients who received vaccinations was as follows  HAV  67   95  CI 28-100    HBV  50   95  CI 28-72    pneumococcal 23  20   95  CI 9 4-31    pneumococcal 13  18 2   95  CI 8-28   and influenza vaccine  16 4   95  CI 7-26    Moreover  the study showed that the proportion of IBD patients who underwent recommended colonoscopy surveillance was 91   95  CI 79-100   and the proportion of women IBD patients who had recommended PAP smear was 30    95  CI 2-58    Regarding bone health  the proportion who underwent DXA bone scans was 36    95  CI 24-49   However  the compliance rate of the Tdap  HPV and Zoster vaccinations  and annual skin examination were poor warranting further quality improvement studies  CONCLUSION  This study revealed that the state of health maintenance among IBD patients seen at our facility before 2021 was largely dismal  Efforts are being taken to improve the proportion of patients who receive recommended vaccinations including annual influenza  pneumococcal 13 and 23  HPV  Zoster  and COVID-19 vaccines  Furthermore  there is a focus on bone health and skin cancer examinations with plans to calculate  report  and publish health maintenance data annually,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35006162
Applying Human-Centered Design Principles to Digital Syndromic Surveillance at a Mass Gathering in India  Viewpoint,In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic  digital health tools have been deployed by governments around the world to advance clinical and population health objectives  Few interventions have been successful or have achieved sustainability or scale  In India  government agencies are proposing sweeping changes to India s digital health architecture  Underpinning these initiatives is the assumption that mobile health solutions will find near universal acceptance and uptake  though the observed reticence of clinicians to use electronic health records suggests otherwise  In this practice article  we describe our experience with implementing a digital surveillance tool at a large mass gathering  attended by nearly 30 million people  Deployed with limited resources and in a dynamic chaotic setting  the adherence to human-centered design principles resulted in near universal adoption and high end-user satisfaction  Through this use case  we share generalizable lessons in the importance of contextual relevance  stakeholder participation  customizability  and rapid iteration  while designing digital health tools for individuals or populations,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35006088

Ventricular repolarization heterogeneity in patients with COVID-19  Original data  systematic review  and meta-analysis,BACKGROUND  Coronavirus disease-2019  COVID-19  has been associated with an increased risk of acute cardiac events  However  the effect of COVID-19 on repolarization heterogeneity is not yet established  In this study  we evaluated electrocardiogram  ECG  markers of repolarization heterogeneity in patients hospitalized with COVID-19  In addition  we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the published studies  METHODS  QT dispersion  QTd   the interval between T wave peak to T wave end  TpTe   TpTe QT  with and without correction   QRS width  and the index of cardio-electrophysiological balance  iCEB  were calculated in 101 hospitalized COVID-19 patients and it was compared with 101 non-COVID-19 matched controls  A systematic review was performed in four databases and meta-analysis was conducted using Stata software  RESULTS  Tp-Te  TpTe QT  QRS width  and iCEB were significantly increased in COVID-19 patients compared with controls  TpTe   82 89 vs  75 33 ms  ms   p-value    005  TpTe QT   0 217 vs  0 203 ms  p-value    026   After a meta-analysis of 679 COVID-19 cases and 526 controls from 9 studies  TpTe interval  TpTe QT  and TpTe QTc ratios were significantly increased in COVID-19 patients  Meta-regression analysis moderated by age  gender  diabetes mellitus  hypertension  and smoking reduced the heterogeneity  QTd showed no significant correlation with COVID-19  CONCLUSION  COVID-19 adversely influences the ECG markers of transmural heterogeneity of repolarization  Studies evaluating the predictive value of these ECG markers are warranted to determine their clinical utility,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35005792
Rapid conversion of Tai Chi classes from face-to-face to virtual during the COVID-19 pandemic  A quality improvement project,PURPOSE  The purpose of this quality improvement project was to examine the feasibility of rapidly converting a Tai Chi program for older Veterans from face-to-face to virtual classes  METHODS  Eighteen Veterans attending our face-to-face Tai Chi course were invited to transition to virtual classes  Feasibility was defined as the ability of program staff and participants to successfully connect and complete the initial and subsequent classes by VA Video Connect  VVC  with little to no technical difficulties  participant ability to participate in the course without safety concerns  and favorable feedback from participants and program staff  RESULTS  Nine of 18 Veterans agreed to transition to the virtual program and attended a median  interquartile range  of 11  4-15  classes  they were younger  62 7   11 5 vs  70 5   7 0 years  p <  05  and more likely to have the knowledge and equipment needed to participate  78  vs  0   p <  01  than nonparticipants  Tai Chi instructors and participating Veterans reported being able to connect to and complete the classes virtually with only minimal technical problems  No adverse events were reported  Feedback from the instructors and Veterans was positive and included comments on ease of use and enjoyability  CONCLUSION  Results suggest that virtual Tai Chi classes via VVC are feasible for some older Veterans,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35005787
